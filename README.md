OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

This project is a simple command-line Quiz Game implemented in C++. The game consists of three multiple-choice questions related to sports, where players can select an answer from four provided options. The game evaluates the player's responses and provides feedback based on the final score.

Features:
Questions: The game includes three pre-defined sports-related questions, each with four answer choices.
User Interaction: Players input their answers by selecting a number corresponding to their chosen option.
Score Calculation: The game tracks the player's score based on correct answers.
Feedback: After completing the quiz, the game displays the player's final score out of 3 and provides feedback depending on their performance.
How It Works:
Introduction: The game starts with a welcome message and instructions for answering the questions.
Quiz Loop: The game presents each question one by one, prompts the user to input their answer, and then checks if the answer is correct. It displays a message indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
Final Score: Once all questions are answered, the game calculates and displays the final score.
Feedback: Based on the player's score, the game gives feedback ranging from "Excellent!" for a perfect score to "Better luck next time!" for a score of zero.
